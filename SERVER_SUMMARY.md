# Gerrit Review Server Summary

## What's Ready

*   **Environment Setup:** The server (`src/server_direct.py`) loads essential configuration (Gerrit URL, username, API token) from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.
*   **Gerrit Client:** An `aiohttp` client session is managed using a lifespan context manager (`gerrit_lifespan`), ensuring the session is properly created on startup and closed on shutdown.
*   **API Request Handling:** A robust helper function (`make_gerrit_request`) handles making authenticated requests to the Gerrit REST API, including URL encoding for change IDs and basic error handling (404s, API errors, network errors). It also correctly parses the JSON response, removing Gerrit's magic prefix.
*   **Individual Draft Comments:** Functionality to create individual draft comments on Gerrit changes has been implemented. These comments remain as drafts and are not published immediately.
*   **Flexible Comment Targeting:** Draft comments can be targeted at either a specific line number *or* a specific range within a file (defined by start/end lines and characters).
*   **Review Submission:** The ability to submit all draft comments and apply a Code-Review label (-1 or -2) to a change has been implemented.
*   **Testing:** The `test_server.py` script successfully initializes the server, fetches various details about a specific Gerrit change (commit info, change details, message, related changes, file list, file diffs), and uses the `gerrit_create_draft_comment` tool to post draft comments for changed lines found in the diffs.

## Available Tools in `src/server_direct.py` and Their Responsibilities

1.  `gerrit_get_commit_info`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Fetches basic commit information (like commit SHA, author, committer, dates) for the *current revision* of a given change.
    *   **Parameters:** `change_id` (string)

2.  `gerrit_get_change_detail`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Retrieves detailed information about a specific change, including revisions, messages, owner, status, etc. Requires authentication (`/a/` prefix).
    *   **Parameters:** `change_id` (string)

3.  `gerrit_get_commit_message`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Fetches just the commit subject and message body for the *current revision* of a change. Requires authentication (`/a/` prefix).
    *   **Parameters:** `change_id` (string)

4.  `gerrit_get_related_changes`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Finds changes related to the *current revision* of a given change (e.g., based on commit history or cherry-picks). Requires authentication (`/a/` prefix).
    *   **Parameters:** `change_id` (string)

5.  `gerrit_get_file_list`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Lists all files modified in the *current revision* of a change, along with status (added, modified, deleted) and other metadata. Filters out the `/COMMIT_MSG` pseudo-file. Requires authentication (`/a/` prefix).
    *   **Parameters:** `change_id` (string)

6.  `gerrit_get_file_diff`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Fetches the diff content for a *specific file* within the *current revision* of a change. It parses the diff response to provide a structured list of line changes (added, removed, common) with line numbers. Requires authentication (`/a/` prefix).
    *   **Parameters:** `change_id` (string), `file_path` (string)

7.  `gerrit_create_draft_comment`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Creates a *single draft comment* on the *current revision* of a change. This comment is *not* published automatically. Requires authentication (`/a/` prefix). It uses the `PUT /drafts` endpoint.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `change_id` (string)
        *   `file_path` (string)
        *   `message` (string): The content of the comment.
        *   `line` (Optional\[int]): The specific line number for the comment. **Provide EITHER `line` OR `range_input`**.
        *   `range_input` (Optional\[Dict[str, int]]): A dictionary specifying the range (`{"start_line": int, "start_character": int, "end_line": int, "end_character": int}`). **Provide EITHER `line` OR `range_input`**.

8.  `gerrit_set_review`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Submits all draft comments for a change and applies the specified Code-Review label. This tool publishes all draft comments that have been created and sets the Code-Review label. No new comments are created by this tool; it only publishes existing draft comments.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `change_id` (string): The ID of the change to review
        *   `code_review_label` (int): The value for the Code-Review label (-1 or -2)
            - Use -1 for non-critical issues (style, minor improvements)
            - Use -2 for critical issues (bugs, security issues, major design problems)
        *   `message` (Optional[string]): An optional message to include with the review

In summary, we have a solid foundation for interacting with Gerrit to fetch change information, create draft comments flexibly, and submit reviews with appropriate labels.
